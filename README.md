# Sales Prediction — Machine Learning Regression Project
This project focuses on developing a predictive model capable of estimating future sales based on historical data and influential factors such as marketing spend, store attributes, seasonal trends, product categories, and customer behaviour. The objective is to create a data-driven framework that helps understand what drives sales fluctuations and how businesses can anticipate demand.

The workflow includes data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory analysis, and visualisation to uncover key relationships in the dataset. Multiple regression models are trained and compared to determine which approach delivers the most accurate predictions. Evaluation metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R² are used to assess model performance and reliability.

This repository is well-suited for learners and practitioners interested in forecasting, regression modelling, business analytics, and practical applications of machine learning. It provides a structured foundation that can be extended into advanced time-series forecasting or integrated into real-world decision-making systems.
